# Quote Machine
Quote Machine Project - freeCodeCamp

In this project I tried to make a simple web page displaying one of the products of HP.

Things I learnt:
- How to use HTML, CSS and Javascript together to make a project
- How to use vanilla js to add interactivity to the page

This page is built using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
